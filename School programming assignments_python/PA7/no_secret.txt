If you think encryption is fun, you might want to consider a career in
cryptography!  It's used in all sorts of real applications including
ATM cards, computer security, electronic commerce, and national
defense.  I very much enjoyed reading a book on crytography called The
Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum
Cryptography by Simon Singh and recommend it highly.
